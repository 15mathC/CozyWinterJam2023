# Cozy Winter Jam 2023 Brainstorming

THEME REVEAL: "Better Together"

-   Mac: I initially thought of this game when I heard the theme: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1176040/I_Have_Low_Stats_But_My_Class_Is_Leader_So_I_Recruited_Everyone_I_Know_To_Fight_The_Dark_Lord/
-   Winter Chik-Fil-A
    -   You have to collect all the Chik-Fil-A employees
        -   Salt the road with waffle fries!
-   Snow has fallen into Atlanta and you 
-   Something involving driving (in the wintery city)
    -   Clear out the road with your fast food
    -   "To keep the joke going, there has to be almost no snow"
-   Something very UI heavy
-   SimCity destroying Atlanta with snow
-   Katamari-like game where you try to make the biggest snowman
    -   Collin: Like the 1st stage of "Spore", where you're trying
    -   Start out as a snowflake, become a snowman
        -   When you roll over an area, the snow goes away, so you're running out of room to move (can't cross your path, like tron)
        -   WASD move, rolling around, could add a kid who's pushing it around, snowball gets bigger
        -   Levels could be successively bigger people/things pushing the snowball around (godzilla-pushing snowball)
            -   kid gets stuck inside of the snowball
            -   Above a certain size, you can pick stuff up
            -   GOAL! Pick up certain snowmen
            -   HAS to be a loss condition - could be a timer, could be 
                -    Could have time pickups - "add 30 seconds" (ice pickup)
            -   When it goes over snow, changes from snow to dirt
            -   Can have different snowball textures for different items picked up/different levels of dirtiness (or just have the items)
        -   You have to be X big before you can run over certain things
        -   "Have to make the biggest snowball you can before mom calls you inside for dinner"
            -   Maybe you have a brother, or a bully, who's making snowballs with you
            -   Could pick up little kids/people who are walking around
            -   Could have "hole in the fence", secret areas you can only go to with a certain size
-   GOALS:
    -   Add everyone to the repo
    -   Decide on a direction

-   Want a 2D game, isometric view (maybe do 3D w/ 2D graphics?)

-   Created a GitHub repo for the project
-   James created a Trello board for the 

-   James'll do the top-down 2D prototype, Mac'll do the isometric 2D, I'll try the 3D prototype
